# BilingualText
A simple python script that translates english text to japanese with furigana. 

The main goal is to help get acustomed to reading kanjis. Obviusly ther will be some problems with text matching, but i guess it 85% accurate so you can use it as a training wheels and later switch to normal japanese content.

To use it you need to adjust destination of the Font. (iom new to python so i m not sure how to get relatives paths) pdf.add_font("MPLUSRounded1c", "", r"D:\2_projects\7_simplePDF\MPLUSRounded1c-Medium.ttf")

Maaybe, later i will fix some of this, probably will need to figure out mutlithread translation, because now file size of the 300 pages can take an hour to process.
